When I tap the scrollable button to scroll through the cards in the player’s card box, the scrolling itself works perfectly. However, during this action, several other parts of the game interface blink or flicker briefly — including the computer’s cards, the market deck, and the center card (the one facing up).

The same issue also happens when either the player or the computer taps the market deck to draw a card. During the draw action, the player’s cards, the market deck, and the center card all blink for a split second, even though only the draw animation should occur.

In addition, when the game is sharing (dealing) the cards at the beginning of the round, a similar blinking happens.
